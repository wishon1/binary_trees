+ Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General
1. What is a binary tree
2. What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
3. What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
4. What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
5. What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
6. What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree

* More Info
Data structures
Please use the following data structures and types for binary trees. Don’t forget to include them in your header file.

+ Basic Binary Tree:
/**
 * struct binary_tree_s - Binary tree node
 *
 * @n: Integer stored in the node
 * @parent: Pointer to the parent node
 * @left: Pointer to the left child node
 * @right: Pointer to the right child node
 */
struct binary_tree_s
{
    int n;
    struct binary_tree_s *parent;
    struct binary_tree_s *left;
    struct binary_tree_s *right;
};

typedef struct binary_tree_s binary_tree_t;

+ Binary Search Tree
typedef struct binary_tree_s bst_t;

+ **AVL Tree
typedef struct binary_tree_s avl_t;

+ Max Binary Heap
typedef struct binary_tree_s heap_t;

+ Note: For tasks 0 to 23 (included), you have to deal with simple binary trees. They are not BSTs, thus they don’t follow any kind of rule.

+ Print function
To match the examples in the tasks, [you are given this function](https://github.com/alx-tools/0x1C.c)

This function is used only for visualization purposes. You don’t have to push it to your repo. It may not be used during the correction
